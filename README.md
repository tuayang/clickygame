This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Clicky Game

The application renders Pokemon images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.
The application keeps track of the user's score, which is incremented by one when a Pokemon image is clicked on for the first time. The user's score is reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Each time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
The user's goal is to guess 20 Pokemon images in a straight shot to earn the top score.
